// Q122: Write a C program that opens an existing file (e.g., info.txt) and reads its contents using fgets(). The program should print all the lines to the console until EOF (end of file) is reached.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
File: info.txt (Content: Name: Rahul\nAge: 23)
Output 1:
Name: Rahul
Age: 23

*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
 {
    FILE *file;


    char line[256];  // Buffer to hold each line read from the file

    // Open the file info.txt in read mode ("r")
    file = fopen("info.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {



        printf("Error: Could not open file info.txt\n");
        return 1;  // Exit if file cannot be opened
    }

    // Read lines from the file until EOF is 
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file) != NULL) {
        // Print each line to the console



        printf("%s", line);

    }

    // Close the file after reading all lines
    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}
